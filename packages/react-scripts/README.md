**NOTE**

`react-scripts` are adapted to

- include `css-modules` and the `stage-0`-preset for babel.
- fix [a bug with `style-loader` and `css-modules`](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/style-loader/issues/182),
- include more PostCSS-plugins: `postcss-cssnext`, `postcss-focus`, `postcss-reporter`.

They can be found in the `npm`-registry under `artirigo-react-scripts`.


**VERSIONS**

As the current version in the `package.json` already points to `v1.0.14` and is published to npm, I added a label to the version until the original `react-scripts` are equal to or higher than `v1.0.15` and we can get back to the same version again.
